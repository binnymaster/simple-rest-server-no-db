       <p> Many ask, "How can you mix spirituality and social service?"
We ask, "How can you separate the two?"

Those who wish to sincerely serve society must be spiritually pure and only those who are spiritually pure can sincerely serve society! 

Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) is a socio-spiritual Hindu organization with its roots in the Vedas. It was revealed by Bhagwan Swaminarayan (1781-1830) in the late 18th century and established in 1907 by Shastriji Maharaj (1865-1951). Founded on the pillars of practical spirituality, the BAPS reaches out far and wide to address the spiritual, moral and social challenges and issues we face in our world.  </p>

<p>The core philosophical principles, disciplines, and practices which identify the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha and its followers are rooted in ancient Hindu scripture, the Vedas.  This solid foundation resonates with millions of people around the world:

    We are the atma and are not this body.  This atmagnan is essential for a spiritual aspirant to reach Paramatma.
    Spiritual aspirants should not consume addictive substances nor should they eat onion, garlic, and other tamasic foods.  A vegetarian diet (no meat, no eggs, no poultry, and no seafood) should be followed.  One should not steal.  One should not commit adultery.
    Bhagwan Swaminarayan is always present on Earth through the gunatit guru. We are the atma and are not this bodyIts strength lies in the purity of its nature and purpose.jay saminarayan.
